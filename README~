------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chart version 0.99.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is the first stable release of a general-purpose graphing
module.  It uses Lincoln Stein's GD module for graphics primitives.  It
allows easy generation of line, bar, point, point-and-line, stacked bar,
and composite charts.


----------
INSTALLING
----------

The usual.

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

This should install to your site_perl directory.  The test scripts also
put samples of the different charts in the samples/ directory.
