Hi,
    I am using the x y plot feature on this and have already modified it a bit 
for my use but I need a feature in the base to limit what is shown on the chart based 
on the x value, 
just like the min_val variable does for the y limit. 
Any easy way to do this? Thanks!

     1 - Selectable point symbols for Points - LinesPoints  
         'circle', 'donut', 'triangle', 'upsidedownTriangle', 'square', 
         'hollowSquare', 'fatPlus'
         (filled circle, open circle, filled diamond, open diamond, etc)

     Points.pm:
     New option (default): brushStyle => 'FilledCircle'
     # brushStyle => 'donut'
     #brushStyle => 'fatPlus'
     #brushStyle => OpenCircle
     #brushStyle => FilledDiamond
     #brushStyle => OpenDiamond
     #brushStyle => Star;
     #brushStyle => FilledRectangle;  # not programmed yet
     #brushStyle => OpenRectangle;  # not programmed yet
     #brushStyle => Cross;  # not programmed yet
     #
     # geaendert: _prepare_brush: offset! angefuegt
     # Fehler!
     # vgl. Base.pm pointStyle: Was ist damit?

     LinesPoints.pm:
     New option (default): brushStyle => 'FilledCircle'
     brushStyle => OpenCircle
     brushStyle => FilledDiamond
     brushStyle => OpenDiamond
     #brushStyle => FilledStar; # not programmed yet
     #brushStyle => OpenStar;   # not programmed yet
     
     2 - Data labels for Points, LinesPoints, Bar, StackedBars
     3 - Composite chart - when combining LinePoints and Mountain the use of
         min_val results in this error "Use of uninitialized value in
         multiplication (*) at C:/Perl/site/lib/Chart/Base.pm line 2041"
     4 - Composite chart - support up to 3 chart types - 
         for example: Mountain, StackedBars, LinesPoints

4)It would be useful to add additional information to a chart (for example
a summary)

I've attached a diff that shows what to change...

Then you can do

  $chart->set( additionals => ['one row', 'a second row'] );


5) Add getopts()
   Add dumpGetOpts()



Pie.pm:
-------

1) It not possible to remove the title without removing the space occupied by the 
   title element 
   (I mean it would be nice to reduce/remove all the border element on the left, 
    on the right and on the bottom)


2) It not possible to set the
    'grey_background' => 'false',
    'colors' => {
                   'misc' => 'white',
                   'background' => 'white',

without loosing all the pie colours. The image appear completely blank

3) It is not possible to set up the ray of the Pie




Composite.pm

Additionally it turned out for me to be much more convenient to limit 
the y-ticks to just one side, since they are equal for both graphs. 
Since there was no option-switch to apply this setting 
I would like to suggest adding the common 'y_axes' key in _draw_y_ticks(). 
Since the old behavior should be kept a new default 'both' is needed 
which can easily be applied in a wrapping new() function.

Please find my suggestions attached in diff-ub patch format. 
Feel free to incorporate them in a(ny) new release of the Chart::Composite module.

An example output with my modified Chart::Lines/Composite Modules can be 
shown at
http://www.zweiernet.ch/wetter . As you can see It shows also the 
endmost data value as an
over_popup based on the imagemap_data.
