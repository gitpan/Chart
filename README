------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chart version 0.99c-pre3 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**** WARNING ****

This version of chart has replaced gif support with png support due to the
Unisys patent problems.  This is the first png-enabled release.

This version has fixed the x-axis placement bug in 0.99b, and all
existing functionality, save for gif creation should be stable.

New (and incomplete) area pattern functionality is currently Mountain.
See t/mountain.t for calling details.

Please send comments/patches/etc to ninjaz@webexpress.com (read: the current
pattern API is subject to change)

----------

There are some very nice additions this iteration.  Specifically, black & white
readability has been extremely improved by custom points for LinesPoints & 
Points, and patterns are now optional.  Mountain Charts have also been added.


----------
INSTALLING
----------

The usual.

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

This should install to your site_perl directory.  The test scripts also
put samples of the different charts in the samples/ directory.


-------------
PREREQUISITES
