Chart::* version 0.93
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is an alpha release of a general-purpose graphing module 
using Lincoln Stein's GD.pm for graphics primitives.  It allows easy 
generation of line, bar, point, point-and-line, stacked bar, pie, and 
pareto graphs, and is designed to be easily modified/extended/built
upon.


----------
INSTALLING
----------

The usual.

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

This should install to your site_perl directory.  The test scripts also
put samples of the different charts in the samples/ directory.
