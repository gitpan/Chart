-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chart version 0.99
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is the first stable release of a general-purpose graphing
module.  It uses Lincoln Stein's GD module for graphics primitives.  It
allows easy generation of line, bar, point, point-and-line, stacked bar,
and composite charts.
	Please note that this is a complete rewrite of the previous
version of Chart.  As such, and home grown hacks may be broken by using
this new version.  Also, this new beta DOES NOT HAVE Pie and Pareto
charts.  If you install this over the old version of Chart, you will
need to erase Pie.pm and Pareto.pm from your site_lib directory.
	Again, this is just a beta for 1.0, so it is probably buggier
than version 0.94.  So use it at your own risk.  :)


----------
INSTALLING
----------

The usual.

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

This should install to your site_perl directory.  The test scripts also
put samples of the different charts in the samples/ directory.
