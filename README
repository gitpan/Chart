------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chart version 0.99b
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is mainly a bugfix release for 0.99a.  The primary changes are a fix
for user-defined dataset colors, and adding a no_cache option for http
headers.  no_cache is currently experimental, because, unfortunately,
Netscape 4.5 breaks with POST while using this.  I'm looking into workarounds,
and if anyone has ideas, feel free to mail me: ninjaz@webexpress.com

Also, look for new and improved Pie charts with the next release!

Enjoy. :)

----------
INSTALLING
----------

The usual.

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

This should install to your site_perl directory.  The test scripts also
put samples of the different charts in the samples/ directory.
