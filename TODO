Short term:
-----------
- Composite:
   When using bars in both, an option is necessary to define whether
   to put the bars above each other or to put aside.
   Add an option to start x-ticks at the left (i.e. 0 point) side and
   end at the right side
- Reorganize the relationship between
  autoscale, 
  y_ticks, min_y_ticks, max_y_ticks, xy_plot, integer_ticks_only, skip_int_ticks,
  min_val, max_val
  and document it.
  (At the moment the autoscale is used as the default)
- Include Skyplot (Direction->polar) into the distribution   
- Add an option to lines, linespoints to start at (0,0) point not only
  if option xy_plot is active
- Add chart type candlestick

- Correct pie chart:
  - Add a flat pie chart where the legend appears on the left
    of the chart, and the chart itself is about 50% smaller

- Base class:
  - Some labels on the top of each axis not printed: i.e.,
      the graph goes to 100.6 but 100.6 is not printed. 
  - Define an option to force the first point sits at the left border of
    the graph, and the last point sits at the right border, without any spaces.
   

- Bars chart:
  - User would like to override the color of specific bars in a Chart::Bars graph.
  - Program should croak if a color is not defined for a bar.
  - Within one Bar graph, I have two datasets, but would like to change the 
    width of one of them (it should have a width of 1, to indicate a limit).
  
- Composite chart:
  - Define different brush_sizes for example with one Lines dataset 
    and one LinesPoints dataset. 
    
- Add output for png without header as modperl generates the headers
  by itsself.
  
- Add output for gif again as the new GD module defines it again.

Long term:
----------
- 3-D charts
- include TrueType fonts as soon as GD supports it
- include logarithmic x- and y-axis
- Let plot arbitrary xy-functions in a defined area, like
  y=sin(1/x)+2*x
